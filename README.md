# Carbon-Emissions-Estimation-App
Spearheaded the development of a sophisticated mobile application using Xcode, Swift, and API technologies to precisely calculate carbon credits and emissions originating from agricultural land. Efficient app that accurately measures carbon footprints, considering various factors like fossil fuel usage, soil health, and livestock activities.

This is the main code for the app however the logo image and few other images within the app wont work.
